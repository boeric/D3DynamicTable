## D3 Dynamic Array of Tables

Demonstrates the the use of D3 to manage an array of tables. Via a button, the user will cycle through several steps which will mutate the underlying array of arrays, which at each step is fed to the table **update** function. For example, tables are added and removed from the array of tables, individual rows of tables are added and removed, and individual table cells are modified. The **update** function demonstrates the enter, exit and update patterns at the div/table level as well as at the table row level.
